# TICTACTOE

In this project I have built an arduino based tic-tac-toe game , where the first player is the human and the second player is the arduino itself.A led matrix was used to represent the tictactoe board. A simple keypad was used take the input and every time the player gives an input the arduino checks for the winning conditions and other possible conditions and it blocks the other player move the player has the chance of winning or it turns on the led light where still no one played yet.
